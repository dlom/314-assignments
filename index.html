					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Mark Old.  Currently, I am studying computer
						science at Gonzaga University, with an expected
						graduation date of May 2018.  My major passions in the
						field of CS are more focused towards lower-level
						programming (close to the metal) and the
						collection/processing/analysis of large sets of data.
						However, with this website I've taken the time to expand
						my horizons and fill out my skillset a little more.
						Aside from programming (which is one of my major hobbies
						outside of schoool), I also enjoy winter sports and
						tabletop/traditional gaming.

					<h2>Samuel L Jackson</h1>
					<p>And now, a couple of quotes from my favorite actor: Samuel L Jackson.</p>
					<blockquote>
						Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes...
						Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come
						home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year.
						And the good thing about dogs... is they got different
						dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of
						dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's best friend...
						or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going to give me a
						dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul.
						Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						Like you, I used to think the world was this great place
						where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then
						some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
						world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world
						where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's
						world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules,
						then you're gonna have to pay the price.
